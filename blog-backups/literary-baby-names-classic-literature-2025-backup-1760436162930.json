They’re distinctive, drenched in rich backstories, and have the uncanny ability to make you look like you’ve got a first-class ticket to the world of high culture. As we flip through the pages of literary gems and delve into character-driven names, we’re setting the stage for your little one to be the main character in their own story. With the likes of Emma Watson championing gender equality and the TikTok #BookTok crew keeping classic novels alive and buzzing, it’s time to open the book on literary baby names that are ready to take on 2025 with style. </p>\n\n<h2>American Classics: Timeless Treasures 🇺🇸✨</h2>\n<p><strong>Atticus</strong> (Latin, Male, means \"from Attica\"): This iconic name demands respect, much like its namesake Atticus Finch from \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" who redefined courage without the need for superpowers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Scout</strong> (English, Unisex, means \"first explorer\"): An explorer’s name as timeless as your little one’s spirit, ready for the adventure of a lifetime—be it in books or in the wilds of a backyard expedition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gatsby</strong> (English, Male, a surname): Channeling the glam of the roaring '20s, your tiny Gatsby will steal hearts at every juice box soirée, jazz playlist optional!</p>\n\n<h2>British Literary Elegance 🇬🇧💫</h2>\n<p><strong>Darcy</strong> (Irish, Unisex, means \"dark one\"): Brooding yet irresistible like Mr. Darcy from \"Pride and Prejudice.\" Who knew a name could carry both a quizzical eyebrow and a charming smirk?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Emma</strong> (German, Female, means \"universal\"): A favorite among the literati, thanks to Jane Austen’s matchmaking dynamo.
