## 🚀 Next Steps

Due to context limits, I recommend we complete these posts in batches:

**Option A**: Continue creating all 35 in this session (may hit token limit)
**Option B**: Create batches of 10-12 posts per session (3 sessions total)
**Option C**: Create templates for all 35, user can fill in details

**Recommendation**: I'll create comprehensive outlines + metadata for all 35 posts, then you can ask me to flesh out specific posts as needed.
