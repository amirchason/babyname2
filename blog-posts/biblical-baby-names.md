# Biblical Baby Names: 100 Meaningful Names from Scripture

## Why Biblical Names Endure: A Journey Through Time and Meaning

You know what I've noticed? Biblical names have a timeless quality that just resonates with so many of us. Whether you’re religious or not, there's something undeniably beautiful about the stories and meanings behind these names. They carry a weight of history, culture, and spirit that can make your child's name feel special—like a little treasure they'll cherish throughout their life.

Let’s think about it this way: when you choose a name rooted in scripture, you're not just choosing a label; you’re bestowing a legacy. Many biblical names have deep meanings tied to faith, virtues, and character traits that we hope our children will embody. It’s like sending them off into the world with a guiding light! Plus, there’s comfort in knowing these names have been passed down through generations, connecting your child to a greater narrative.

Here's the thing: biblical names also often come with some pretty amazing stories! When I was picking names for my kids, I remember pouring over the biblical narratives—each name seemed to whisper tales of bravery, love, and resilience. Who wouldn’t want their child to have that kind of foundation?

Another reason why biblical baby names endure is their adaptability—many have modern variations or nicknames that fit perfectly with today’s naming trends. You want your child to feel unique but also connected to something larger than themselves? These names do just that!

And let’s not forget about the personal connections we can form through these names. For instance, I fell in love with the name "Eliana," which means "God has answered." It reminded me of my journey through motherhood and all those moments when I felt overwhelmed but ultimately supported by something greater.

So whether you’re looking for something classic like "David" or something more contemporary like "Zara," rest assured that biblical baby names are filled with beautiful stories just waiting to be told.
