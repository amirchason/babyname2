He's sleeping the sleep of someone who has zero awareness that his entire identity, his first impression at every job interview, his Instagram handle, and potentially his therapy session topics all hinge on a decision his exhausted, emotionally compromised father is supposed to make in the next six hours.</p>\n\n<p>The nurse just left. \"So, Dad,\" she said with the casual tone of someone asking about the weather, \"what's the little guy's name for the birth certificate?\"</p>\n\n<p>I may have blacked out for a second.</p>\n\n<h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>\n\n<p>Let me rewind to nine months ago when my wife Emily showed me that positive pregnancy test. After the initial shock wore off (approximately three weeks later), we did what every modern couple does: we made lists.</p>\n\n<p>Emily's list was thoughtful, organized by origin, with pronunciation guides and meaning annotations. My list was... well, it existed. It included \"Maverick\" (I'd been watching Top Gun), \"Atticus\" (we'd just finished reading To Kill a Mockingbird), and inexplicably, \"Optimus.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"You want to name our son after a Transformer?\" Emily asked, one eyebrow raised in that way that means I should probably rethink my life choices.</p>\n\n<p>\"He's the leader of the Autobots!\" I protested weakly. The name came off the list.</p>\n\n<p>We spent months in what I now call The Great Name Wars of 2024. Every conversation somehow circled back to names. Dinner? \"What about Oliver?\" Car ride? \"Is Jasper too... much?\" Even during a particularly intimate moment, Emily whispered, \"I really like Theodore.\"</p>\n\n<p>Nothing killed the mood quite like imagining our future son at his first day of kindergarten.</p>\n\n<h2>The Family Pressure Cooker</h2>\n\n<p>If you think choosing a name is just about you and your partner, buckle up. The moment we announced the pregnancy, both sets of grandparents activated their name campaigns with the subtlety of political lobbyists.</p>\n\n<p>My dad cornered me at Thanksgiving. \"Your grandfather's name was Walter,\" he said, voice heavy with meaning. \"It would honor the family legacy.\"</p>\n\n<p>The family legacy. No pressure there.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Emily's mom sent us a fifteen-page document (I'm not exaggerating—FIFTEEN PAGES) titled \"Family Names Worth Considering,\" complete with genealogy charts dating back to the 1800s. There were names in there I couldn't even pronounce. Eustace? Hieronymus? Were these people or law firms?</p>\n\n<p>\"What about something from my side?\" Emily suggested one evening, tentatively. \"My uncle Miguel—\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Miguel Thompson?\" I interrupted. \"Honey, we're about as Hispanic as mayonnaise on white bread. Wouldn't that be... appropriation?\"</p>\n\n<p>She sighed. \"Miguel married into the family. He's from Milwaukee and his real name is Mike.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another name off the list.</p>\n\n<h2>The Midnight Google Spiral</h2>\n\n<p>Around month seven, I entered what my wife called my \"unhinged\" phase. I'd wake up at 2 AM, grab my phone, and spiral into increasingly bizarre Google searches:</p>\n\n<p>\"Names that sound strong but not douchey\"</p>\n<p>\"Baby names that won't get my kid beat up\"</p>\n<p>\"Names that work for both a baby and a CEO\"</p>\n<p>\"Can you name a baby after a vegetable if it's a cool vegetable\"</p>\n\n<p>That last one was at 4 AM after a particularly vivid dream about a baby named Arugula. Emily was not amused when I shared this over breakfast.</p>\n\n<p>I discovered forums—oh god, the forums. There's a whole universe of people passionately debating whether \"Aiden\" is overdone (consensus: very yes) and if \"Kai\" sounds too much like \"sky\" said with a cold (surprisingly contentious).</p>\n\n<p>I read blogs, consulted baby name books, and even bought a numerology guide that promised to reveal the \"vibrational energy\" of names. According to that book, the name \"Brandon\" has the same energy as a wet sock. I felt personally attacked—that was on my list.</p>\n\n<h2>The Compromise Wars</h2>\n\n<p>Emily and I had always prided ourselves on being a team, partners who communicated well and made decisions together. The name situation revealed that we were actually two stubborn mules wearing human suits.</p>\n\n<p>\"Sebastian,\" Emily proposed one evening.</p>\n\n<p>\"Too fancy. He'll never live up to it.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Liam?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Too common. There'll be six Liams in his kindergarten class.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Jackson?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Sounds like he should own a craft brewery.\"</p>\n\n<p>Emily threw up her hands. \"Okay, genius, what's YOUR suggestion?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Ezra,\" I said, feeling proud of myself. \"It's biblical, not too common, works across cultures—\"</p>\n\n<p>\"It sounds like a grandpa who tells the same three stories at every family gathering.\"</p>\n\n<p>We sat in silence, both realizing we'd become the people we mocked in those baby name forums.</p>\n\n<p>The compromise system we developed was elaborate and slightly ridiculous. We each got five vetoes, no explanation needed. We created categories: \"Classic But Not Boring,\" \"Modern But Not Trendy,\" \"Strong But Not Aggressive,\" and my personal favorite, \"Names That Sound Good When Yelled Across a Playground.\"</p>\n\n<p>We were down to three names by month eight: Henry, Isaac, and Miles. We figured we'd know which one fit when we saw him.</p>\n\n<p>Spoiler alert: we did not know which one fit when we saw him.</p>\n\n<h2>The Delivery Day Debacle</h2>\n\n<p>Labor was 14 hours of intensity I wasn't prepared for, despite six weeks of birthing classes where I learned absolutely nothing useful except how to make sympathetic noises. When our son finally arrived, squalling and red-faced and absolutely perfect, the nurse asked, \"Name for the baby?\"</p>\n\n<p>Emily and I locked eyes. We had three names ready. We'd debated, discussed, and deliberated for months.</p>\n\n<p>\"We need a minute,\" I said.</p>\n\n<p>The nurse smiled knowingly. She'd seen this before.</p>\n\n<p>We tried all three names out loud, whispering them to his tiny scrunched-up face. Henry? He didn't look like a Henry. Isaac? Didn't feel right either. Miles? I suddenly remembered that kid named Miles from middle school who ate glue.</p>\n\n<p>Nine months of preparation, hundreds of hours of discussion, and we were back to square one.</p>\n\n<p>\"What about...\" Emily started, then stopped.</p>\n\n<p>\"What?\"</p>\n\n<p>\"What about Thomas? We took it off the list because I thought it was too simple, but... look at him. Doesn't he look like a Thomas?\"</p>\n\n<p>I looked. Really looked. Thomas. Tommy as a kid, Tom as a teenager, Thomas on his business cards someday. It worked. It was strong without being aggressive, classic without being stuffy, simple without being boring.</p>\n\n<p>\"Thomas James,\" I said, adding my grandfather's middle name. \"What do you think, buddy? You a Thomas?\"</p>\n\n<p>He yawned, which we took as approval.</p>\n\n<h2>The 3 AM Revelation</h2>\n\n<p>Which brings us back to 3:17 AM, me holding Thomas James Thompson (yes, two Thomases—we committed to the bit) and having what can only be described as a mild anxiety attack.</p>\n\n<p>What if we'd made the wrong choice? What if Thomas was too common after all? What if he hated it? What if he grew up to be a musician and \"Thomas James Thompson\" didn't look cool on album covers? What if—</p>\n\n<p>Thomas squeaked—not quite a cry, just a tiny sound that translated roughly to \"Hey, I'm here, and I'm hungry, and I don't care what you call me as long as you figure out this feeding thing.\"</p>\n\n<p>And just like that, the panic lifted.</p>\n\n<p>I was overthinking this. (Shocking, I know.) I'd been so focused on choosing the perfect name that I'd lost sight of something fundamental: the name doesn't make the person. The person makes the name.</p>\n\n<p>Thomas could be whoever he wanted to be. He could be a Thomas who runs marathons or writes poetry or builds robots or teaches kindergarten or becomes a professional dog walker. The name was just a starting point, a label, a way for people to get his attention.</p>\n\n<p>The important part—the part I'd been losing sleep over—wasn't in the name itself. It was in how we'd raise him, the values we'd teach him, the love we'd show him, the confidence we'd help him build.</p>\n\n<p>Did I just have a profound parenting revelation at 3 AM while sleep-deprived and probably still in shock? Yes. Yes, I did.</p>\n\n<h2>Three Months Later: The Thomas Report</h2>\n\n<p>I'm writing this now with three months of Thomas-being-Thomas under my belt. And here's the thing nobody tells you about baby names: whatever you choose becomes THE name. It becomes your kid's name. It's impossible to imagine them being called anything else.</p>\n\n<p>When I look at Thomas now, I can't imagine calling him Henry or Isaac or Miles, and certainly not Optimus (though Emily brings that up whenever she wants to win an argument). He's Thomas. Our Thomas. He makes the name his own just by being him.</p>\n\n<p>Do I occasionally wonder if we should have chosen differently? Sure. Usually at 3 AM when he's crying and nothing works and I'm pretty sure I'm doing everything wrong. But then he'll grab my finger with his tiny hand or give me that goofy milk-drunk smile, and I think, \"Yep, that's my Thomas.\"</p>\n\n<p>The name isn't perfect. No name is. But it's ours, and more importantly, it's his.</p>\n\n<h2>What I Learned (Besides How to Function on Two Hours of Sleep)</h2>\n\n<p><strong>There's no such thing as a perfect name.</strong> Every name has pros and cons. Every name can be mispronounced or made fun of or seem too common or too weird depending on who you ask and when. You're not choosing perfection; you're choosing what works for your family.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Everyone will have opinions.</strong> Smile, nod, and do what feels right to you. Grandpa Walter is great, but if you don't want a Walter, you don't need a Walter. Your kid, your choice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trust your gut.</strong> All the baby name books and apps and websites are tools, but at some point, you have to make a decision. When you find the name that feels right, you'll know. Or you won't, and you'll pick one anyway and it'll become right.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The midnight Google spiral is normal.</strong> You're not crazy for searching \"can a CEO have a name that ends in Y\" at 2 AM. Well, you might be a little crazy, but you're not alone in your craziness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use resources that make it easier.</strong> Apps like SoulSeed (soulseedbaby.com) were actually helpful during my less unhinged moments. The Tinder-style swiping feature let me go through hundreds of names quickly, and I could save favorites to compare later. Emily and I would spend evenings swiping through options together, and it somehow made the overwhelming process feel more like a game and less like we were determining our child's entire future with one decision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The name will fit eventually.</strong> Even if it feels wrong at first, give it time. Your baby will grow into their name, and the name will grow around them. Before you know it, you'll forget you ever had doubts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Keep perspective.</strong> Yes, naming a human is a big deal. But it's not the only big deal. It's not even in the top ten of big deals you'll face as a parent. (Spoiler: dealing with a blowout that somehow defied the laws of physics ranks higher.)</p>\n\n<h2>To the Parents-to-Be in the Trenches</h2>\n\n<p>If you're reading this at 2 AM, seven months pregnant, frantically Googling \"names that don't sound try-hard,\" I see you. I was you. I might still be you, just with a baby attached to my chest and a concerning coffee habit.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I wish someone had told me: you're going to be okay. The name you choose will be okay. Your baby will be okay. Better than okay—they'll be amazing, no matter what you call them.</p>\n\n<p>The anxiety you're feeling isn't really about the name. It's about the weight of responsibility, the realization that you're in charge of a whole human life, the fear that you might mess it up somehow. That's the real 3 AM crisis, and the name is just where all that fear happens to land.</p>\n\n<p>But here's the secret: the fact that you care this much means you're already doing it right. You're not going to mess this up. You're going to love your kid fiercely and do your best, and your best will be enough.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you do briefly consider naming them after a Transformer.</p>\n\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\n\n<p>Naming Thomas was one of the most stressful, anxiety-inducing, argument-causing experiences of my life. It was also weirdly bonding, occasionally hilarious, and ultimately meaningful in ways I didn't expect.</p>\n\n<p>Would I do it differently if I could go back? Maybe I'd stress less. Possibly skip the numerology book. Definitely avoid that forum where someone suggested \"Danger\" as a middle name so kids can say \"Danger is my middle name\" (I almost went for it).</p>\n\n<p>But I wouldn't change the name. Thomas James Thompson is perfect for our son because he's our son. The name isn't what makes him special—he makes the name special.</p>\n\n<p>And that, I think, is the whole point.</p>\n\n<p>Now if you'll excuse me, Thomas needs a diaper change, and I need to add \"professional poop analyst\" to my resume.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to parenthood.</p>\n\n<h2>FAQ: The Questions I Asked That No One Answered</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Q: How do I know if a name is \"too trendy\"?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Check the Social Security Administration's popular names list. If it's in the top 10 and you want something unique, maybe reconsider. But also? If you love it, use it. Your kid won't be the only one with that name, and that's fine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Should I tell people the name before the baby is born?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Only if you want opinions you didn't ask for. We kept it secret, which was smart. Once the baby is here with the name, people are way less likely to say, \"Oh, I knew a Kevin who was a jerk.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What if my partner and I can't agree?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Welcome to marriage. Compromise, communicate, and if all else fails, the person who did the labor gets the deciding vote. That's the rule.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Is it okay to change your mind after the baby is born?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. You usually have a few days before the birth certificate needs to be filed. We almost changed Thomas to Oliver on day two. (We didn't, but we could have.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: What if I regret the name later?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> You probably won't. But if you do, nicknames exist, and people change their names legally all the time. It's not the end of the world. Though maybe avoid this by not naming them Optimus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q: Do baby name apps actually help?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Apps like SoulSeed made the process way less overwhelming. The filtering options helped narrow down our preferences, and the favorites list let us keep track without endless spreadsheets. Plus, the meanings and origins were actually accurate, unlike some random websites we found.</p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Three months into this whole dad thing, I've learned that most of parenting is showing up, trying your best, and accepting that you'll never feel 100% ready or sure about anything. Naming Thomas was my first lesson in that, and I suspect it won't be my last.</p>\n\n<p>The name isn't the important part. The kid is the important part. The love is the important part. The rest is just details.</p>\n\n<p>But I'd still suggest avoiding \"Optimus.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>Thomas James Thompson is now three months old and has no idea his dad almost gave him a Transformer name. We plan to tell him when he's 18 and see if he thinks it's funny or therapy-inducing.</em></p>\n\n<!-- BLOG_NAME_LIST_COMPONENT -->\n\n</body>\n</html>",
