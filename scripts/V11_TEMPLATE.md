## SAMPLE V11 OUTPUT (Liam excerpt)

**Instead of V10**:
```
Historical Figures:
- Liam O'Flaherty (1896-1984) - Irish novelist and short story writer
```

**V11 writes**:
```
Liam O'Flaherty (1896-1984) was an Irish literary giant whose novels captured the rugged beauty of the Aran Islands. Winner of the 1926 James Tait Black Memorial Prize, O'Flaherty wrote with an intensity that matched his name's warrior spirit. His novel "The Informer" became an Academy Award-winning film, cementing Liam as a name associated with artistic brilliance and Irish cultural pride.
```

**The difference**: V11 tells a story that makes you care, not just lists a fact.
