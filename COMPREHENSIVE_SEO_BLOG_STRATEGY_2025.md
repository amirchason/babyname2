## 13. RISK MITIGATION

### Potential Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Google Algorithm Updates**

- **Action**: Diversify traffic sources (Pinterest, social, direct)

**Challenge 2: Indexing Issues**
- **Risk**: Pages not indexed despite optimizations
- **Mitigation**: Monitor Search Console, fix technical issues
- **Action**: Consider Next.js migration for SSR if needed

**Challenge 3: High Competition**
- **Risk**: Can't rank for high-volume keywords
- **Mitigation**: Focus on long-tail, build authority gradually
- **Action**: Target 100+ low-competition keywords first

**Challenge 4: Content Quality at Scale**
- **Risk**: 65+ posts = consistency issues
- **Mitigation**: Strict quality standards, GPT-4o for consistency
- **Action**: Manual review of every post before publishing

**Challenge 5: Domain Authority**
