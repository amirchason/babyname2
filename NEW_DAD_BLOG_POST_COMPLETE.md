## 📱 SoulSeed Integration

### Mention 1 (Natural Integration)
Located in "What I Learned" section:

> "Apps like SoulSeed (soulseedbaby.com) were actually helpful during my less unhinged moments. The Tinder-style swiping feature let me go through hundreds of names quickly, and I could save favorites to compare later. Emily and I would spend evenings swiping through options together, and it somehow made the overwhelming process feel more like a game and less like we were determining our child's entire future with one decision."

**Why it works:**
- Presented as helpful tool, not sales pitch
- Specific feature mentioned (swiping)
- Shows real use case (couples using it together)
- Acknowledges anxiety while offering solution
- Natural part of "tools that helped" advice

### Mention 2 (FAQ Section)
Located in FAQ answer:

> "Yes! Apps like SoulSeed made the process way less overwhelming. The filtering options helped narrow down our preferences, and the favorites list let us keep track without endless spreadsheets. Plus, the meanings and origins were actually accurate, unlike some random websites we found."

**Why it works:**
- Answers real question parents have
- Highlights specific features (filtering, favorites)
- Adds credibility claim (accuracy)
- Conversational, not promotional
- Solves stated problem (overwhelm)
