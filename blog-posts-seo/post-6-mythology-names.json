These names come with epic backstories, making your kid's introduction instantly legendary. Plus, with superhero epics and fantasy series dominating pop culture playlists, names like <strong>Athena</strong> and <strong>Thor</strong> are giving serious main character energy. With celebrities like Kanye West and Gal Gadot diving into this pool of epicness, these names are ready to take over the playgrounds of 2025.</p>\n\n<h2>Greek Myths: Gods and Glory 🌈</h2>\n<p><strong>Athena</strong> (Greek, means wisdom): Zeus's brainchild, literally! Popping out fully formed from his head, she's the OG feminist icon. Athena's all about wisdom and war strategy—just imagine her with a smartphone in her hand, crushing it on Instagram like a boss.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Persephone</strong> (Greek, means bringer of destruction): Queen of the Underworld and the ultimate duality queen, Persephone's story gives us the drama we crave. With her around, every season change feels like a mini-series finale. Sephy is a name for those who know life's more than just black and white.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Apollo</strong> (Greek, means sun, music, prophecy): The poster boy of Greek mythology, he's the sun god with a keen ear for music and a knack for stirring prophecy. With a name like Apollo, your little dude is set to be the star of every talent show and a future Grammy contender.</p>\n\n<h2>Norse Notables: Thunder and Tricksters ⚡</h2>\n<p><strong>Thor</strong> (Norse, means thunder): Thanks to Marvel's Chris Hemsworth, Thor is not just a name—it's a lifestyle. Imagine your kiddo wielding not a hammer, but a pencil or a paintbrush, ready to create storms of wonder in the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Loki</strong> (Norse, means trickster): Mischief managed! Loki's name is synonymous with charm and cheek—a potent combo that ensures your little one will forever keep you on your toes. It's perfect for the kid who will rewrite the rules!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Freya</strong> (Norse, means love, beauty, war): This goddess of everything fabulous is a rising star on the name charts. Freya is for the little fashionista who will rule both the runway and the battlefield of life with equal flair—extra style points for the Insta-ready nickname, Frey!</p>\n\n<h2>Celtic Charms: Magic and Lore 🍀</h2>\n<p><strong>Brigid</strong> (Irish, means exalted one): Bridie's got the trifecta of fire, poetry, and healing, making this name music to any parent's ears. She's the one you call when you need a touch of magic or a poem to brighten your day.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maeve</strong> (Irish, means she who intoxicates): Warrior queen vibes come standard with this name. Maeve is for the one who's unapologetically fierce, ready to conquer kingdoms—or just the classroom debate team.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dylan</strong> (Welsh, means son of the sea): With roots tracing back to the Welsh sea god, Dylan flows effortlessly through time. Plus, with a musical namesake like Bob Dylan, your little one is prepped to play life like a harmonious melody.</p>\n\n<h2>Why These Names Work in 2025</h2>\n<p>In 2025, baby names need to be like a viral meme: unique, memorable, and share-worthy.
