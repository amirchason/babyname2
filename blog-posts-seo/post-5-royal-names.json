  "content": "<h1>Regal & Royal Baby Names That Slay for 2025 👑</h1>\n\n<h2>Why Royal Names Are Giving Main Character Energy</h2>\n<p>Royal names have always been a vibe, but thanks to the likes of The Crown, Meghan and Harry's adventures, and the TikTok obsession with all things Bridgerton, they're positively ruling our hearts right now. These names aren't just for the aristocrats anymore—everyone wants a bit of that royal sparkle! ✨</p>\n\n<h2>British Royal Names: Timeless Elegance with a Modern Twist 👸🤴</h2>\n<p><strong>Elizabeth</strong> (Hebrew, means God is my oath): Queen Elizabeth II totally bossed the longest reign game, making this name synonymous with power. Lizzie or Beth just screams timeless class.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charlotte</strong> (French, means free woman): Thanks to little Princess Charlotte, this name has been trending harder than any viral TikTok dance. Charlie or Lottie makes it cute yet regal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Henry</strong> (German, means estate ruler): Prince Harry may be chilling in Cali now, but his real name carries a history of powerful kings. Whether you go with Hank or Hal, you can’t miss with this one.</p>\n\n<p><strong>William</strong> (German, means resolute protector): From William the Conqueror to Prince Will, this name has been crushing it for centuries. Will or Liam, anyone?</p>\n\n<h2>European Royal Names: Continental Flair for Your Little Monarch 🇫🇷🇪🇸</h2>\n<p><strong>Isabelle</strong> (Hebrew, means God is my oath): French queens knew what was up with this elegant name. Bella or Izzy is giving us major Disney princess vibes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Felipe</strong> (Greek, means lover of horses): King Felipe of Spain rocks this name with that exotic flair. Feli sounds fresh and modern for your future heartbreaker.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anastasia</strong> (Greek, means resurrection): Thanks to the legendary Romanov stories and a certain animated movie, Anastasia is both mysterious and enchanting. Call her Stasia or Ana for short.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Magnus</strong> (Latin, means great): With nods to Norse kings and even pop culture (hello, Magnus Bane from Shadowhunters), this name is ruling all the charts. Mags or Gus keeps it casual yet cool.</p>\n\n<h2>Why These Names Work in 2025 🚀</h2>\n<p>No matter the decade, a royal name comes with that built-in wow factor. Whether you're imagining your child as the next big CEO or the star of their TikTok channel, names like <strong>Elizabeth</strong> or <strong>Alexander</strong> are timeless and global. Plus, they come with endless nickname potential!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts: Your Little Royal’s Reign Begins 👶✨</h2>\n<p>Choosing a royal name for your kiddo isn't just about snagging a piece of history—it's about crafting a legacy for their future.
