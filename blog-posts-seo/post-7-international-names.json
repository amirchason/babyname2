International names are effortlessly cool, with celebs like Penélope Cruz and Shakira setting the trend. Milan, anyone? (Yes, the city and the name!) These names are not just about the glam factor; they're all about blending global flair with everyday practicality. </p>\n\n<h2>Romantic Romance Language Names ✨</h2>\n<p><strong>Luca</strong> (Italian, means bringer of light): Thanks to movies like *Call Me By Your Name*, Luca is giving off some serious romantic leading man vibes. Bonus: it's gender-neutral chic!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gianna</strong> (Italian, means God is gracious): Gianna got a glow-up thanks to Kobe Bryant’s daughter. With nicknames like Gia and Gigi, this name is practically strutting down the runway.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marco</strong> (Italian, means warlike): Whether you're inspired by Marco Polo or just love the sound (and potential for spontaneous Marco Polo pool games), Marco is a timeless, strong choice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Elena</strong> (Italian/Spanish, means bright, shining light): Spotted on *The Vampire Diaries* and loved by all, Elena is the perfect blend of elegance and international appeal. Lena or Ellie? Take your pick!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Matteo</strong> (Italian, means gift of God): With its romantic flair and rising star status, Matteo is the Italian cousin of Matthew that's crushing it in English-speaking countries.</p>\n\n<h2>Vivacious Spanish Gems 💃</h2>\n<p><strong>Sofia</strong> (Spanish, means wisdom): This name is the Sophia of the world’s stage, always in the top 10 and giving off smart, classy vibes—or should I say,\"main character energy\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>Diego</strong> (Spanish, means supplanter): With creatives like Diego Rivera and athletes like Diego Maradona, this name is as artistic and athletic as it gets. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Luna</strong> (Spanish/Latin, means moon): A celestial name that has charmed the globe, from Harry Potter to Chrissy Teigen’s daughter. Luna, you're out of this world! 🌙</p>\n\n<p><strong>Carlos</strong> (Spanish, means free man): There's something regally cool about Carlos. With a name like this, your kid is bound to rule—metaphorically, of course.</p>\n\n<h2>Chic French Flair 🥖</h2>\n<p><strong>Juliet</strong> (French, means youthful): Who doesn’t want a little Shakespearean romance in their life? Juliet is a classic that never ages—ironic, right?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Xavier</strong> (Basque/French, means new house): Thanks to Professor X, this name’s got superhero written all over it. Exotic and accessible—time to save the day!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Margot</strong> (French, means pearl): Think Margot Robbie’s glamour meets vintage sophistication. This name doesn’t need a nickname; it’s already iconic.</p>\n\n<h2>Why These Names Work in 2025 🔮</h2>\n<p>Names that travel well are like those versatile shoes you can wear anywhere—they just work!
