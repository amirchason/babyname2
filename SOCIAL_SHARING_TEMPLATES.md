Hey namenerds! As a 90s baby myself, I got curious about whether nostalgia is affecting baby naming trends. Turns out - it totally is!

• Sabrina jumped 109 spots in one year
• Boys' names like Brandon and Tyler are returning

Made a full breakdown of which 90s names are coming back and why (spoiler: it's us millennials becoming parents 😅).

Title: Spent 40 hours researching strollers so you don't have to - here's what I learned

Body:
I'm 28 weeks and went down a DEEP rabbit hole researching strollers. Tested 6 in person, watched 50+ YouTube reviews, joined Facebook groups... I may have a problem 😅

Key findings:
• Don't buy before baby comes (you might not need one right away)
• The "best" stroller depends on your lifestyle (city vs suburbs makes a HUGE difference)
• Expensive ≠ better (some $200 strollers outperform $1000 ones)

Put together a full guide with pros/cons of 15 top strollers: soulseedbaby.com/blog/best-strollers-2025

What stroller did you go with? Any regrets?
```

**Facebook Group**:
```
🚼 Stroller recs? I'm so overwhelmed!

38 weeks here and STILL haven't picked a stroller. Every review contradicts the last one! 😩

Did a ton of research and realized the "best" totally depends on your lifestyle. Made a guide comparing 15 top strollers by category (travel, jogger, budget, etc).

Check it out: soulseedbaby.com/blog/best-strollers-2025

What stroller do you use? Would you buy it again? 💕
